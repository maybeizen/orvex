## Security Best Practices

### For Developers

1. **Authentication**

    - Always use the Laravel authentication system
    - Implement password policies using `PasswordPolicyService`
    - Enable and encourage two-factor authentication
    - Enforce login throttling for failed attempts

2. **Authorization**

    - Use Laravel's Gates and Policies
    - Follow the principle of least privilege
    - Validate user permissions for each action
    - Never trust client-side authorization

3. **Data Validation & Sanitization**

    - Always validate user input using form requests
    - Use the `SanitizeInput` middleware for additional protection
    - Apply the `no_sql_injection` validation rule for sensitive fields
    - Be cautious with raw database queries

4. **Session Security**

    - Never store sensitive data in sessions
    - Use HTTP-only cookies
    - Use secure cookies in production
    - Implement proper session timeouts

5. **Database Security**

    - Use Laravel's query builder or Eloquent (avoid raw queries)
    - Use database migrations for schema changes
    - Limit database user permissions
    - Encrypt sensitive data before storage

6. **API Security**

    - Use Laravel Sanctum or Passport for API authentication
    - Implement rate limiting
    - Validate all API inputs
    - Use HTTPS for all API endpoints

7. **File Uploads**

    - Validate file types, sizes, and extensions
    - Store uploaded files outside the web root
    - Generate random filenames
    - Scan uploads for malware when possible

8. **Error Handling**
    - Use custom error pages in production
    - Never expose stack traces to users
    - Log errors securely
    - Don't reveal sensitive information in error messages

### For System Administrators

1. **Server Configuration**

    - Keep the server up to date with security patches
    - Use a firewall and restrict access to necessary ports
    - Implement fail2ban or similar for brute force protection
    - Set up proper file permissions

2. **SSL/TLS Configuration**

    - Force HTTPS on all pages
    - Use strong cipher suites
    - Implement HSTS
    - Keep certificates up to date

3. **Regular Maintenance**

    - Update Laravel and all dependencies regularly
    - Run `composer audit` to check for vulnerabilities
    - Use `php artisan security:audit` to check security settings
    - Perform regular security scans

4. **Backups and Recovery**
    - Maintain regular, encrypted backups
    - Test backup restoration procedures
    - Have a disaster recovery plan
    - Store backups securely off-site

## Security Headers

The application implements the following security headers:

- **Content-Security-Policy**: Prevents XSS by restricting resource loading
- **X-Content-Type-Options**: Prevents MIME type sniffing
- **X-Frame-Options**: Prevents clickjacking by controlling framing
- **X-XSS-Protection**: Provides some XSS protection in older browsers
- **Referrer-Policy**: Controls information in the Referer header
- **Permissions-Policy**: Restricts browser features

## Two-Factor Authentication

Two-factor authentication is available and strongly recommended for all users. Administrators can monitor 2FA adoption using the security audit command.

## Security Audit

Run the security audit command to check for common security issues:

```bash
php artisan security:audit
```
